### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Daniel Isakov.

For many years I have been a critical care doctor in pediatric hospital. Sometimes at work it was necessary to develop some kind of programms to make documentation and worflow easier. Not apps but kind of snippets in VBA mostly. They really helped my work. At this present moment I have realized, that I like coding and I'm stuck... I need to learn more to go further. So I've started to study Java since Nov 2020. And this turned my life around. I do want my hobby to turn into a career.
