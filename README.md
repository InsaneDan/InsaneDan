### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Daniel Isakov.

For many years I was a critical care doctor in pediatric hospital. Sometimes it was necessary to develop some kind of programms to make life easier. It wasn't apps but kinda snippets in VBA mostly. They were really helpful in my work. At the moment I realized, that I like coding and I'm stuck... I need to learn more to go further.
So I've started to study Java since Nov 2020. And this turned my life around. I do want my hobby to turn into a career. So we'll see how it goes.

### My mottos:
* "The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why." â€“ Mark Twain
* "Regardless of what you dream of - start working on it! And then real miracles will begin to happen in your life," â€“ Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
* "Whether you think you can, or you think you can't - you're right." â€“ Henry Ford
